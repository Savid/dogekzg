[KZG Ceremony client](https://github.com/ethereum/kzg-ceremony) with all the features you never wanted;

- ✅ 200% more un-maintainable code
- ✅ Streamlined with no tests or documentation to bog you down
- ✅ Almost 20mb of pure html, css, javascript and WASM. Fun for the whole family!
- ✅ Golang WASM single threaded monster that compiles with everything including the kitchen sink
- ✅ Music that can't be turned off
- ✅ Tested on at least one device (and it ran!)
- ✅ A plot no one ever asked for
